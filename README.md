# BLU-Net


An end-to-end network compression framework transfering knowledge from full-precision vanilla U-Net to binary U-Net (BLU-Net).

- Our compressed model, BLU-Net, has an 82.7Ã— smaller size and a remarkable segmentation accuracy of 85.4% IoU (3.4% lower than full-precision vanilla U-Net) on our custom dataset.

- We demonstrate that fine-grained hint learning and binarisation can transfer segmentation knowledge across different network architectures, from full-precision vanilla U-Net to binary BLU-Net.

- To our knowledge, this is the first work in binary neural networks for biomedical image segmentation.
